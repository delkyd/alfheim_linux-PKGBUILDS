NBAN WILL IRRECOVABLY DESTROY ALL DATA ON ALL ATTACHED DRIVES

Ninja Boot'N'Nuke(NBAN) is and "End of Life" solution that is built around Arch
native tools. The end result is to wipe all data from all attached storage
media by zerofilling them. If SATA secure erase is available, then that is used
instead. This will secure data off machines which are no longer in use, but
have sensative data, for allow for their disposal.

The core NBAN image is an initcpio profile, that loads storage drivers, and then
uses dd in parallel to overwrite all drives with zeros and then reboots.

NBAN WILL IRRECOVABLY DESTROY ALL DATA ON ALL ATTACHED DRIVES

	-USAGE-

1. Compile nban directly with mkinitcpio

# mkinitcpio -p nban

You can then set nban.img as initrd= at boot time via bootloader config.

2. "Shuriken"

The Ninja "Shuriken" is nban.img plus a base extlinux bootloader on a flash
drive. to make a shuriken, you can use the shuriken_forge script. Where sdX is
a blank flash drive. you can use this to wipe any computer that boots off a
flash drive, that is also capable of running arch linux.

$ shuriken_forge </dev/sdX>

Please note, that shurikens are not intellegent and will overwrite themselves.

3. reboot_nuke.sh

If you are using syslinux as your boot loader, you can use reboot_nuke.sh to
overwrite your bootloader and reboot into boot and nuke. reboot_nuke_press.sh
is designed to be tied to a button that will nuke after a certain about of
repeated button presses. This is for tying to keyboard shortcuts. You can use
these to santize your Arch workstation quickly in case of an event requiring
immediate santiation of data.

The default is 3 button presses in 0.8 seconds.

	-CONFIG-
Configuration is at the top of all scripts, except the initcpio profiles which
you can edit in their /etc/ directory. See -FILES- Below for more details
