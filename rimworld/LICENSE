================== License clarification ===================
============================================================

In purchasing RimWorld, you purchase a perpetual license to install and use the software on up to five devices you own.

You may not share game files or download links thereof. You may not install the software on someone else's machine.

By modding the game you agree to these restrictions:
        -You're welcome to make whatever mod you like and distribute it as broadly as possible.
        -You may only distribute RimWorld mods non-commercially (for free) without discriminating who takes them.
        -You may accept donations, but they may not be tied to the delivery of a specific product or service.

This is not a complete description of the license. By writing this partial license agreement here, Ludeon Studios does not give up any other rights, express or implied. These notes are simply for clarification.
