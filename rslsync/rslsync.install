	* Running rslsync system instance (using dedicated rslsync:rslsync account)

  	  System instance of rslsync is preconfigured (configuration file located
	  at /etc/rslsync.conf) and can be used directly after installation.

	  Execute:

	    to reload system systemd modules:     systemctl daemon-reload
	    to start rslsync manually:             systemctl start rslsync
	    to autostart rslsync on system start:  systemctl enable rslsync

	* Running rslsync user instance (using current user account)

	  User instance MUST be configured before use. To perform configuration, 
	  install rslsync-autoconfig package or follow manual configuration steps:

  	    1. Copy /etc/rslsync/rslsync.conf to ~/.config/rslsync/rslsync.conf for
 	    the user you wish to configure rslsync:
 	
	      mkdir -p ~/.config/rslsync	
	      cp /etc/rslsync.conf ~/.config/rslsync/rslsync.conf
 
	    2. Replace user-specific references with the appropriate information,
	    including the following settings:
 
	      - storage_path
	      - pid_file
	      - webui.listen
	      - webui.login
	      - webui.password

	    3. Make sure folder you specified as storage_path and folder where pid_file will
	    be located both exist in the filesystem, since rslsync will not create it for you.

	  Execute:

	    to reload user systemd modules:       systemctl --user daemon-reload
	    to start rslsync manually:             systemctl --user start rslsync
	    to autostart rslsync on user login:    systemctl --user enable rslsync
