ONLINE MULTIPLAYER

To play online multiplayer (EA passed support of this service to XWIS):
    1. Run the game
    2. At the Main Menu click Internet. After a series of messages you will be
       at the username creation screen.
    3. XWIS allows you to ignore the 'New Account' button. Enter any username, 
       and a password 8 characters long.
    4. Select your country location and desired server, then hit OK. You
       should be taken to the main online lobby where you can join/create games
       if users are online.

LAN MULTIPLAYER

Tiberian Sun's LAN Multiplayer natively uses IPX. To replace this with UDP, a replacement binary is required. Download  ts_ra2_lanpatch_1_00.zip  and place  wsock32.dll in the game's  SUN/  directory (under $HOME/.tiberiansun/). Note that this patch will break online multiplayer, but it can simply be removed to restore that functionality.

GAME SERIALS

An unfortunate oversight of EA, when they released the game as freeware, was forgetting about the multiplayer mode's check on game serials. When more than two people join a game, they have to have unique serial numbers. Fortunately, there is a way around this, however it requires downloading a utility released by a software cracking group.

Razor 1911 released  rzrtsfix.zip  in 1999. This zip contains an executable that will set a random serial number for your game. Read the NFO file in the zip for more information.

One potential source of the serial zip (caution, this is not the safest site on the internet): http://gf.wiretarget.com/tiberian_sun.htm
Scroll to the bottom and download the link labelled "Serial Changer Done by Razor 1911"

To execute the utility properly, extract the executable somewhere, cd into the  SUN/  directory (under $HOME/.tiberiansun/), and run the following:
WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.tiberiansun/tiberiansun" WINEARCH="win32" wine $pathToUtility
