HOTP-TOTP.PHP v4.4.1
====================

Introduction
------------

This project consists of two PHP files:

	* index.php
	* index_oauth.php

These files generate HTML forms that can be used to generate one-time password
values based on:

	* HOTP: An HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm (rfc4226)
	* TOTP: Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm (rfc6238)
	* OCRA: OATH Challenge-Response Algorithm (rfc6287)

Further, it also supports the client side of the OAuth protocols (1.0a
and 2.0).


How to Use
----------

1.	Copy `index.php' and `index_oauth.php' to a location readable by a
PHP-aware web server, such as ~/public_html in your home directory
(assuming `User Home Directories' are enabled).


2.	Open `index.php' in your web-browser.

3.	Read the instructions on the generated page, choose the appropriate
algorithm and click "NOW!"


Notes
-----

A newer GSMA-side Mobile Connect version has been published since this 
version of HOTP-TOTP.PHP was released.

The next release of this software will include new GSM-specific OpenID
Connect code.

Thank you!
