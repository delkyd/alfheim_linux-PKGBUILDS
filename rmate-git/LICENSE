This is a message from the package maintainer of rmate-git.

While the upstream project (https://github.com/textmate/rmate) has
not provided an actual license file as of 2017-09-17, they do state
in the `rmate.gemspec` file that the project is licensed under the
MIT license.

Even though the rmate-git package does not technically require
`rmate.gemspec`, it is included in the /usr/share/licenses/rmate
directory for reference.
