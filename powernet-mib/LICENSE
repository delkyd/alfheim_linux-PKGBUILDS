This software license agreement (the “agreement”) is a legal agreement between American Power Conversion
Corporation as the “licensor” (hereafter referred to as APC) and you (hereafter referred to as the “customer”) for
the APC software accompanying this agreement.

following is true:
• You have been authorized to accept these terms on behalf of the customer (the entity on whose behalf you
represent that you are authorized to act).
• You intend to be personally bound to the terms of this agreement as the customer.
If you accept these terms as a representative of an entity on whose behalf you are authorized to act, you may use

and licensor with regard to that software.
