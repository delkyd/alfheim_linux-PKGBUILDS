# The official website is long gone, but:
# - the soundfont itself is available on a few other websites
# - It's readme was posted here: http://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3019215
# Rather than downloading the soundfont from websites without permission or bothering to get one,
# I made it available publicly on my own Dropbox account.

# The license is from the "Copyright Notice" section of the readme.
# It states also that the soundfont is released in the public domain, but
# that some sounds included did not have any copyright information.
# For details, please see the readme.
