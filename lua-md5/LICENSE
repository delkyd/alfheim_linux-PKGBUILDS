MD5 is free software: it can be used for both academic and commercial purposes at absolutely no cost. There are no royalties or GNU-like "copyleft" restrictions. MD5 qualifies as Open Source software. Its licenses are compatible with GPL. MD5 is not in the public domain and PUC-Rio keeps its copyright. The legal details are below.

The spirit of the license is that you are free to use MD5 for any purpose at no cost without having to ask us. The only requirement is that if you do use MD5, then you should give us credit by including the appropriate copyright notice somewhere in your product or its documentation.

MD5 was designed and implemented by Roberto Ierusalimschy and Marcela Ozório Suarez. The implementation is not derived from licensed software. The DES 56 C library was implemented by Stuart Levy and uses a MIT licence too.
