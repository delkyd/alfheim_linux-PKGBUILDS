.SH DESCRIPTION
mycron is an alternative cron service/daemon. You need to start the systemd service unit or create a init.d file by yourself or simply start mycron manually for each user and run it in the background.
.PP
mycron then replaces your regular crontab setup. It allows you to set up cronjobs in a completely new, but very convenient and standards compliant way and becomes your command center for managing, creating, editing and checking cronjobs.
