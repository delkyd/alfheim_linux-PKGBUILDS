# aur-wekimini

An [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wekimini/) for the [WekiMini](http://www.wekinator.org/) project by Rebecca Fiebrink, which is the newer version of her older Wekinator.

Rebecca's description of the project:
> The Wekinator is free, open source software originally created in 2009 by Rebecca Fiebrink.
> It allows anyone to use machine learning to build new musical instruments, gestural game controllers, computer vision or computer listening systems, and more.
>
> The Wekinator allows users to build new interactive systems by demonstrating human actions and computer responses, instead of writing programming code.
