== Make Package ==

In PKGBUILD, update pkgver to the new nessus version, and update the first md5sums to match
the one on the website for Fedora.

Then run `mksrcinfo`.

Then edit .SRCINFO, removing the line that was just added about 'source = Nessus-...', but keeping the rest of the changes.
If we kept that line, we'd be packaging the rpm with the package, but we want it instead to be downloaded.
(For license reasons, or size reasons, or something...)

Commit and push!


== Test Locally ==

You can do this using the `makepkg` command in the directory containing the PKGBUILD file
`pacman -U /root/Download/packagename.tar.gz`
