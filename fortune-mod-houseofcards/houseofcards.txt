FRANK UNDERWOOD: Such a waste of talent. He chose money over power - in this town,
                 a mistake nearly everyone makes. Money is the McMansion in Sarasota
                 that starts falling apart after 10 years. Power is the old stone
                 building that stands for centuries. I cannot respect someone who does
                 not see the difference.

FRANK UNDERWOOD: You know the difference between you and me, Marty?
MARTY SPINELLA:  What?
FRANK UNDERWOOD: I'm a white-trash cracker from a white-trash town that no one
                 would even bother to piss on. But here's the difference — I've
                 made something of myself. I have the keys to the capitol. People
                 respect me. But you, you're still nothing. You're just an uppity
                 dago in an expensive suit turning tricks for the unions. Nobody
                 respects the unions anymore, Marty. They're dying. And no one
                 respects you. The most you'll ever make of yourself is blowing
                 men like me. Men with real power. Yes. I can smell the cock on
                 your breath from here.
MARTY SPINELLA:  You think you can get under my skin?

                 is influence, but I wield Constitutional authority.
