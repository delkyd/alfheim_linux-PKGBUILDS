  ==> Globus Connect Personal install note:
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  You must create an endpoint before using Globus Connect Personal.

  To set up the endpoint, follow the instruction at
  https://docs.globus.org/how-to/globus-connect-personal-linux/#globus-connect-personal-cli
  to generate a setup key, and run the command below:

  globusconnect -setup <your-setup-key>

  To autostart Globus Connect Personal service, you have two options: a system service or a
  user service.

  Running as a system service ensures that GCP service is run at startup even if the user has
  no active session. Since the system service keeps GCP running even without an active user
  session, it is intended to be used on a server.

  To enable and start the system service:

  # systemctl enable globus-connect-personal@myuser.service
  # systemctl start globus-connect-personal@myuser.service

  where myuser is the actual name of your user.

  Running as a user service ensures that GCP only starts after the user has logged into the
  system (e.g. via the graphical login screen, or ssh). Thus, the user service is intended to
  be used on a (multiuser) desktop computer. It avoids unnecessarily running GCP instances.

  To enable and start the user service:

  $ systemctl --user enable globus-connect-personal.service
  $ systemctl --user start globus-connect-personal.service
