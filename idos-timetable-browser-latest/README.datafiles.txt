Data files are files providing timetable, map or tariff data.

Data files have the following extensions:

  .tt:  Timetable,
  .ttr: Timetable related information (not sure what; maybe meta-information or helper-files).
  .ttm: Map,
  .ttp: Tariff,

Data files are automatically found if residing in the same directory or within one subdirectory of from where the programme is run.

There is a default convention, used by the data files distributed by CHAPS and other sources. Under this convention, data files go into subdirectories Data1, Data2, Data3 or Data4 in the following way:

  Data1/ contains data files related to trains.
  Data2/ contains data files related to busses.
  Data3/ contains data files related to municipal public transport.
  Data4/ contains data files related to flights.
