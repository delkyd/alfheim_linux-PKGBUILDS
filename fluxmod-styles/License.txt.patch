+(Arch Linux) packager's note:
+
+	Only 4 of the themes seem to come with anything resembling a license.  
+    
+    These are:
+    
+    [1] - Bluesier: COPYING
+    [2] - BlueSky: COPYING.gz
+    [3] - Verbena: COPYING
+    [4] - Verde/pixmaps: COPYING.gz
+
+    Their locations within the filesystem should be able to be located using:
+
+    $ pacman -Ql fluxmod-styles | grep [THEME-NAME]
+
+    If you find more, please post a comment on this package's AUR page thing and let me know.
