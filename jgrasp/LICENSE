Section 1. License Grant.

Auburn University grants to you a non-exclusive and non-transferable license to use jGRASP and the associated documentation provided in jgrasp/help, collectively "jGRASP". jGRASP may be installed for use on one or more computers 
or on a local area network. The "wedge" source code provided in the jgrasp/src directory is free of license restrictions. It may be used or modified for any purpose. The plugin source code provided in the jgrasp/extensions 
directory, with the exception of the Web-CAT tool plugin sources, may be used or modified for any purpose, but when linked with the jGRASP jar file, the results may only be used as jGRASP plugins. See the Web-CAT source files for 
license information specific to that plugin. Source code for our slightly modified version of the Eclipse Web-CAT submission plugin is available upon request. jGRASP is a Trademark of Auburn University.

Section 2. Restrictions

Distribution of jGRASP is not permitted without written permission (see Supplements), except that it may be distributed internally within a single organization. Distribution of components of jGRASP separately from the whole is not 
permitted, except that the complete associated documentation provided in jgrasp/help may be distributed separately. Reverse engineering of jGRASP is not permitted. Any use of image files, icons, or executable components of jGRASP 
separately from the whole is prohibited.
