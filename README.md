# Alfheim Linux PKGBUILDS

This is a collection of PKGBUILDS taken directly from the Arch Repositories (Testing, Extra, Core, Community and Multilib) and from the AUR.  Over the weeks and months we will be testing each of the PKGBUILDS and fixing what is broken with them or completely removing them.  This collection is provided for anyone to use and to download the whole repository.  It will be used in the Gudrun Package Manager to provide software to Alfheim Linux.
