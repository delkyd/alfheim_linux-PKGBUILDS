# Both TeamViewer and TeamViewerQS operate in two modes. If you extract the files to a HOME folder
# and just run teamviewer, it will self start a user mode network process to support the gui tool.
# Watch for 'Starting network process (no daemon)' in the console window.
# If you install TeamViewer, the GUI tool expects to attach to it. TeamViewer
# attaches to the service you start as root and TeamViewerQS attaches to an invisible service
# that self starts as non root.

# Self Start: teamviewerd -n -f
# Service:    teamviewerd -d

# The TeamViewer service in 10.0.46203 is broken under Arch Linux. This broke both
# TeamViewer and TeamViewerQS. This shows that TeamViewerQS has a server mode even though
# the server file is invisible and the service can only launch as non root.

# To fix TeamViewerQS we change the scripts so even while installed, QS will start in user mode.
# Since TeamViewerQS cannot be set for permanent startup, there was never a reason to have a
# server mode for TeamViewerQS.

# Others have noted that the non QS .tar.gz download works fine and believe that it is different.
# It isn't different. All downloads are the same except for the per-OS dependencies. What changes
# is that isInstalledTV detects you're running from a user folder and autostarts the user mode
# network process. This mode still works. Unfortunately you lose the ability to autostart
# for incoming connections which is the whole reason why we use the Linux version of TeamViewer.
# Otherwise you could just install TeamViewer for Windows into Wine or a VM.

# To fix TeamViewer we make the scripts detect whether the service has been loaded and load
# the user mode networking or attach to the service as necessary.

# The TeamViewer service works in the Debian Jessie Live ISO i386 and amd64 so the problem should be fixable.
# Until a fix is found we either don't enable the service or go back to 41499.

# TeamViewer has a different configuration between standalone and service. Try this to reset:
#   sudo systemctl stop teamviewerd.service
#   sudo rm -f /opt/teamviewer10/config/global.conf
#   mkdir ~/.config/teamviewer10/config
#   optional: sudo systemctl start teamviewerd.service

# To get started fixing, search the logs for
# systemd: no active session found for display :0, assuming login screen

# I don't use a login screen. I use startxfce4.
