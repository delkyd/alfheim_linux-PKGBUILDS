	* 1.39-1 :
	Version bump to 1.39.

	Upstream changelog (1.32→1.36):
	- Map scale is displayed.
	- Fixed accuracy of Ocean Monuments (6% of displayed monuments did not exist
	  in game, and 2.5% of monuments did not appear in AmidstExporter).
	- Fixed accuracy of temples and witch huts (4.3% did not exist in game, and
	  3% did not appear in Amidst)
	- Improves accuracy of villages. 17% of the villages that were displayed have
	  been correctly eliminated from the map, however 1% of the other villages
	  that were displayed have been incorrectly eliminated with them (these
	  villages exist in the game but are no longer displayed by AmidstExporter...
	  lets spin this: there are now some secret villages!)
	- Minor UI improvements.

	Upstream changelog (1.36→1.37):
	- Abandoned mineshafts can be displayed.
	- Structure coordinates adjusted to better reflect the center of the structure.
	- zoom crash fixed.
	- Minor UI improvements

	Upstream changelog (1.37→1.39):
	- Nether Fortresses are now shown at their Overworld location on the
	  Overworld's biome-map, instead of at Nether scale.
	- Clicking on a Nether Fortress will show its coordinates in both the Nether
	  and the Overworld.
	- Worlds made with Minecraft 1.6 and older had more mineshafts than current
	  versions, now those extra mineshafts can be displayed.
	- AmidstExporter will not try to "update" back to original-Amidst when skiphs
	  releases a new version of Amidst.
