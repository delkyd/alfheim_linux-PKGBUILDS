The files are named dvb-ttpci-VV.fw-vvvv

  VV : Version of firmware-to-host API. You can simply upgrade
       the firmware binary with a newer one of the same API
       version without changing anything else in the driver.
  vvvv: Firmware version. Increased with each functional change.

It is recommended that you use the newest firmware binary
compatible with your driver. If you use the hotplug firmware loader
in Linux 2.6 you must put the firmware file in
/lib/firmware/dvb-ttpci-01.fw (in previous versions of the Linux
hotplug scripts it was /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/dvb-ttpci-01.fw).

Boot.S is the source for the boot loader which is included
as a binary blob in the bootcode array in av7110_hw.c in
the Linux driver source. For more information check the
driver tarball at http://www.metzlerbros.org/dvb/.
