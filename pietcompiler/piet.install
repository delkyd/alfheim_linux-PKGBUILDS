Known bug: If PietCompiler is build on an other system than Linux/x86 it will crash
in the interpreter mode. But it produces working Linux/x86 executables anyway. So at
your x64 system you may use PietCompiler to generate a Linux/x86 binary from your
Piet program and then execute the generated binary seperately.
