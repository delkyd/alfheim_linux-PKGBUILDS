=========Hunter Server Mod===========

The hunter vs everyone else.

*IMPORTANT*: Please return frequently for updates as this mod is new and bugs may be discovered.

Rules:

- 1 player is randomly selected to be the 'Hunter'
- The other players then have to work out who this player is and kill them.
- Friendly fire is always on. It is possible to mistake a normal player with the hunter.
- All Deaths are anonymous, it will not show who killed who. This does not stop players saying it in chat, but they might lie!
- If the hunter dies then everyone else wins.
- If the hunter is last one left then hunter wins.
- The hunter has different Weapon stats than normal players

Differences:

- Hunter has hammer, normal players don't. Hammer is instant kill.
- Hunter's handgun does x2 damage
- Hunter's shotgun can kill in 2 close shots
- Hunter's lazer can kill in 2 close shots
- Hunter's Grenade does not self harm (allowing many rocket jumps) and has visible debris.

IMPORTANT keep this option the same:

sv_tournament_mode 1

Recommended cfg: 

sv_name "Hunter CTF5 *NEW*"
sv_motd "A random player is secretly selected to be hunter. Hunter vs Everyone else. Hunter is stronger."
sv_map ctf5
sv_gametype mod
sv_max_clients 16
sv_register 1
sv_tournament_mode 1

Note for map makers:

- Place extra hearts and shields to help game last longer
- Try not to use death tiles, players have only 1 life.
- Place lasers in harder to reach places, a hunter can use them to quickly kill off normal players so putting it in easy reach can cause a camping issue.
