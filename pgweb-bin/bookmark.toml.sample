# Bookmarks allow you to keep connection settings to your most frequent servers
# with credentials stored in a file on your local filesystem, encoded as TOML.

# Here's an example of a bookmark file (/etc/pgweb/server.toml):
host = "localhost"
port = 5432
user = "postgres"
database = "mydatabase"
ssl = "disable"

# To keep things short, you can just define an url:
url = "postgres://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=mode"
