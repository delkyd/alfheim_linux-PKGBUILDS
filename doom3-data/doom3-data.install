The Doom 3 patch *.pk4 files have been installed to /usr/share/games/doom3.
You _must_ still copy the game *.pk4 files from the Doom 3 CDs or an
installed copy (eg, from Steam, a Windows install, or otherwise) in
order to complete the game.

The files for the base directory are: pak000.pk4, pak001.pk4,
pak002.pk4, pak003.pk4, and pak004.pk4.

If you have Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil, you may also copy its
pak000.pk4 file into the d3xp directory.

STEAM USERS:
Doom 3 requires a CD-key to run; Steam provides CD-keys but does not
normally expose them to owners of the game.  If you can run Steam, you
may be able to right click the game(s) and view the CD key from the
Steam client.  Otherwise, run the game(s) at least once via Steam and
then copy the doomkey and xpkey files from
"Steam/steamapps/common/doom 3/base" into ~/.doom3/base
