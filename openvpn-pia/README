This package installs Private Internet Access's OpenVPN configuration files.
Additionally it allows the storage of your username and optionally your password
for automatic login.

All OpenVPN configuration files are located in /etc/openvpn/client.


## SETUP

To begin, you must put your username as the first line of
/etc/openvpn-pia.conf. You should make the file only accessible to root
as well.

Optionally, put your password as the second line of /etc/openvpn-pia.conf
to enable auto login.

NOTE: PIA does not support IPv6. Disable it:
