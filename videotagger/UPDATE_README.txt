This PKGBUILD is written to pull from github/master.
It does not install the .whl, but installs from github source.
Therefore, NO NEED to build / update python package prior to updating
the AUR.
Pushes to github should update automatically, but when there is a MAJOR POINT RELEASE, push a new version to the AUR after a test build and an .src update, in the usual way (see AUR update notes README notes, ../../).
