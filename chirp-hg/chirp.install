In order to access your radio, you may need to adjust permissions on the serial
device. (Note: device names may vary.)
eg.
  chown USER /dev/ttyUSB0
    or
  chmod o+rw /dev/ttyUSB0

Alternatively, in order to let non-privileged users access the serial device on
their next login, you can add them to the group that owns it.
eg.
  gpasswd --add USER GROUP
