SCROLLS END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT

These end user licence terms set out some rules for downloading and using our game, Scrolls (“Scrolls”). We don’t like rules any more than you do, so we have tried to keep this as short as possible. If you break these rules we may stop you from using Scrolls.

If you buy, download, use or play Scrolls, you are agreeing to stick to the rules of these end user licence terms. If you don’t want to or can’t agree to these rules, then please don’t buy, download, use, or play Scrolls.

These end user licence terms incorporate our Privacy Policy and our Branding and Asset Usage Guidelines. Therefore, the things covered in the Privacy Policy and the Branding and Asset Usage Guidelines should be treated as if they are set out in these end user licence terms. When we refer to this “EULA”, we are referring to these end user licence terms, together with the Privacy Policy and the Branding and Asset Usage Guidelines.
ONE MAJOR RULE

The one major rule is that you must not distribute anything we’ve made. By “distribute anything we’ve made” what we mean is “give copies of Scrolls away, make commercial use of, try to make money from, or let other people get access to Scrolls and its parts in a way that is unfair or unreasonable”. So the one major rule is that (unless we specifically agree it – such as in our brand and asset usage guidelines) you must not:

    give copies of Scrolls to anyone else;
    make commercial use of anything we’ve made;
    try to make money from anything we’ve made; or
    let other people get access to anything we’ve made in a way that is unfair or unreasonable.

...and so that we are crystal clear, what we have made includes, but is not limited to, the client or the server software for Scrolls. It also includes modified versions of Scrolls, part of it or anything else we’ve made.

Otherwise we are quite relaxed about what you do – in fact we really encourage you to do cool stuff – but just don’t do those things that we say you can’t.

USING SCROLLS

You have bought Scrolls so you can use it, yourself, on your computer.

Below we also give you limited rights to do other things but we have to draw a line somewhere or else people will go too far. If you wish to make something pertaining to anything we’ve made we’re humbled, but please make sure that it can’t be interpreted as being official and that it complies with this EULA and the Branding and Asset Usage Guidelines and above all do not make commercial use of anything we’ve made.

The permission we give you to use and play Scrolls can be revoked if you break the terms of this EULA.

When you buy Scrolls, we give you permission to install Scrolls on your own personal computer and use and play it on that computer as set out in this EULA. This permission is personal to you, so you are not allowed to distribute Scrolls (or any part of it) to anyone else. This also means you cannot sell or rent Scrolls, or make it available for access to other people and you cannot pass on or resell any licence keys. You may however give gift codes that have been bought our official gift code system. This is important to help us stop piracy and fraud and to protect Scrolls. It is also important to prevent members of our community from buying pirated versions of Scrolls or fraudulent licence keys – which we may cancel, such as in the case of fraud.

You are also allowed to adapt Scrolls for your own personal (non-commercial) use, but you must not distribute your adaptations in any way that is unfair or adversely affects our rights in Scrolls. Amongst other things, that means that you can’t just rip-off our assets or try to make money out of them. Beyond that, you are not basically allowed to copy, reverse engineer or decompile Scrolls, or to adapt it or modify it in any way.

Within reason you’re free to do whatever you want with screenshots and videos of Scrolls. By “within reason” we mean that you can’t make any commercial use of them or do things that are unfair or adversely affect our rights. Also, don’t just rip art resources and pass them around, that’s no fun.

Essentially the simple rule is do not make commercial use of anything we’ve made unless specifically agreed by us, either in our brand and asset usage guidelines (click here) or under this EULA. Oh and if the law expressly allows it, such as under a “fair use” or fair dealing” doctrine then that’s ok too – but only to the extent that the law says so.

In order to ensure the integrity of Scrolls, we need all Scrolls downloads to come from a single central source: us. It’s also important for us that 3rd party tools/services don’t seem “too official” as we can’t guarantee their quality. Make sure that you read through our brand and asset usage guidelines too.
OWNERSHIP OF SCROLLS AND OTHER THINGS

Although we give you permission to play Scrolls, we are still the owners of it. We are also the owners of our brands and any content contained in Scrolls. Therefore, when you pay for Scrolls, you are buying a permission to play / use Scrolls in accordance with this EULA – you are not buying Scrolls itself. The only permissions you have in connection with Scrolls are the permissions set out in this EULA.

Any tools you write for Scrolls from scratch belong to you. Plugins for Scrolls also belong to you and you can do whatever you want with them, as long as you don’t sell them for money / try to make money from them. We have the final say on what constitutes a tool/plugin and what doesn’t – and something isn’t a tool or plugin if it uses our code or assets.
CONTENT

If you make any content available on or through Scrolls, you must give us permission to use, copy, modify and adapt that content. This permission must be irrevocable, and you must also let us permit other people to use, copy, modify and adapt your content. If you don’t want to give us this permission, do not make content available on or through Scrolls. Please think carefully before you make any content available, because it will be made public and might even be used by other people in a way you don’t like.

If you are going to make something available on or through Scrolls, it must not be offensive to people or illegal, it must be honest, and it must be your own creation. The types of things you must not make available using Scrolls includes: posts that include racist or homophobic language; posts that are bullying or trolling; posts that might damage our or another person’s reputation; posts that include porn, advertising or someone else’s creation or image; or posts that impersonate a moderator or try to trick or exploit people.

Any content you make available on Scrolls must also be your creation. You must not make any content available, using Scrolls, that infringes the rights of anyone else. If you post content on Scrolls, and we get challenged, threatened or sued by someone because the content infringes that persons rights, we may hold you responsible and that means you may have to pay us back for any damage we suffer as a result. Therefore it’s important that you only make content available that you have created and you don’t do so with any content created by anyone else.

Please watch out if you are talking to people through Scrolls’ in-game chat. It’s hard for either you or us to know for sure that what people say is true, or even if people are really who they say they are You should think twice about giving out personal information.
UPGRADES

We might make upgrades and updates available from time to time, but we don’t have to. We are also not obliged to provide ongoing support or maintenance for Scrolls. Of course, we hope to continue to release new updates for Scrolls, we just can’t guarantee that we will do so.
OUR LIABILITY

When you get a copy of Scrolls, we provide it ‘as is’. Updates and upgrades are also provided ‘as is’. This means that we are not making any promises to you about the standard or quality of Scrolls or that Scrolls will be uninterrupted or error free or for any loss or damage that it causes. You have to accept that we may be releasing it well before it is complete and so it may (and often will) have bugs – but that’s a price you pay for getting it so early. The law in most countries says that we can’t disclaim liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence so we’re not but if your computer gets up and stabs you because of something we’ve done, then let us know and we’ll try and deal with it.
SCROLLS IN-GAME ITEMS / FEATURES

As part of and to enhance your use and enjoyment of SCROLLS you may be able to obtain additional features that form part of the SCROLLS experience (“Features”). Features are features of a service that that may used subject to these terms and conditions and on the basis of the licence granted by these terms and conditions.

These terms and conditions and your use of SCROLLS do not give you any rights of ownership in any Features or any property (whether tangible or intangible). Features may include virtual items, power-ups, additional content. Features also include a virtual currency used in and as part of SCROLLS (“Gold”). You may obtain or receive Features (including Gold) free of charge as part of and as a result of your participation in SCROLLS.

Features (like Gold) may be exchanged for other Features in and as part of SCROLLS only.

You may also purchase additional Features using your credit or debit card, SMS, Paypal account or as otherwise described in the payment section of SCROLLS. Such additional Features include “Shards”. Shards may only be obtained in this way.

Shards may be exchanged only for Gold and certain other Features described in SCROLLS as being capable of being exchanged for Shards from time to time.

Other Features such as Gold may not be exchanged for Shards. Gold and Shards are Features and in common with all Features have no cash or real world value.

It is a condition and fundamental term of these terms and conditions and your use of SCROLLS that you may not and must not buy, sell, barter, swap, exchange, trade, lend, rent or otherwise deal in any way with any Feature (including Gold and Shards) outside of SCROLLS or in any way other that as expressly provided above namely that certain Features may only be exchanged for certain other designated Features in and as part of SCROLLS only.

It is a further condition and fundamental term of these terms and conditions and your use of SCROLLS that you may not and must not buy, sell, barter, swap, exchange, trade, lend, rent or otherwise deal in any way with other aspect of SCROLLS including your SCROLLS account, Password or username.

When you buy a Feature you are buying a right to use that Feature within, in and as part of SCROLLS only, in accordance with these terms and conditions. Features that may be purchased are advertised for sale on SCROLLS so that you may offer to purchase them for the price stated in the manner described below.

When you submit a request to purchase Features you are offering to purchase them for the price stated (“Order”).

Orders are subject to these terms and conditions and will be confirmed by e-mail. Orders are deemed accepted when Mojang sends the confirmation e-mail or the feature becomes available to use.

Mojang may cancel any sale and not supply Features if it is reasonable to do so and may change or discontinue the availability of Features at any time at its sole discretion. Mojang may also vary how it makes Features at any time in its sole discretion.

Mojang cannot guarantee that a particular Feature will always be available or will always be available in the same manner. Mojang will not be liable for any consequences of the availability or use (or misuse) of any Feature or its impact on your use of the Game.

The purchase of a Feature (such as Shards) is a service that commences when you or Mojang commence the download of the Feature to your computer or portable device or it is available for use, following which you shall not be entitled to cancel your Order.

If you cannot use a Feature due to an error or fault, please contact Mojang as set out below and Mojang will endeavour to provide you with a replacement version to download and if Mojang is unable to do so you may be entitled to a refund.

If a Feature is faulty or defective please contact Mojang as set out below and Mojang will as soon as reasonably possible provide you with a replacement or provide a refund or credit to your applicable account and remove that Features from your use of SCROLLS.

Charges will appear on your monthly credit card, bank, phone, Paypal or other account statements.

You will not be charged for any Orders that cannot be fulfilled and where appropriate Mojang will recredit to your account any sum debited by Mojang. PLEASE DO NOT SEND CASH. MOJANG MAY NOT ACCEPT CASH (BUT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DO SO). MOJANG WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CASH, POSTAL ORDER, MONEY ORDER OR CHEQUE LOST IN THE POST OR SENT TO BUT NOT RECEIVED BY MOJANG.

Your statutory rights are unaffected by these terms and conditions.
TERMINATION

If we want we can terminate this EULA if you breach the terms. You can terminate it too, at any time, all you have to do is uninstall Scrolls from your computer and the EULA will be terminated. If the EULA is terminated, you will no longer be allowed to play Scrolls. The paragraphs about “Ownership of Scrolls”, “Our Liability” and “General Stuff” will continue to apply even after the EULA is terminated.
GENERAL STUFF

The EULA is subject to any legal rights you might have. Nothing in these terms and conditions will limit any of your rights that may not be excluded under law nor shall it exclude or limit our liability for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence nor any fraudulent representation.

We may also change this EULA from time to time but those changes will only be effective to the extent that they can legally apply. For example if you only use Scrolls in single player mode and don’t use the updates we make available then the old EULA applies but if you do use the updates or use parts of Scrolls that rely on our providing ongoing online services then the new EULA will apply. In that case we may not be able to / don’t need to tell you about the changes for them to have effect so you should check back here from time to time so you are aware of any changes to the EULA. We’re not going to be unfair about this though – but sometimes the law changes or someone does something that affects other users of Scrolls and we therefore need to put a lid on it.

If you come to us with a suggestion for Scrolls that suggestion is made for free. This means we can use your suggestion in any way we want and we don’t have to pay you for it. If you think you have a suggestion that we would be willing to pay you for, you must tell us you expect to be paid before you tell us the suggestion.

If there’s anything legal you’re wondering about that isn’t answered from this page, don’t do it and ask us about it. Basically, don’t be ridiculous and we won’t.
