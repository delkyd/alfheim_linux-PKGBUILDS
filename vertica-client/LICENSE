• You may not use software to provide services to third parties.
• You may not distribute, resell, share or sublicense software to third parties.

• You may copy the Software for archival purposes or when it is an essential step in authorized use so long as You retain any product identification, trademark, copyright or other notices in the Software.

If HP makes a license management program for recording and reporting license usage information, you will use such program no later than 180 days from the date it’s made available.

7. Ownership. No transfer of ownership of any intellectual property in the Software and any derivative works thereof will occur under this Agreement. All rights not granted are reserved.

9. Intellectual Property Rights Infringement. HP will defend and/or settle any claims against you that allege that HP-branded software as supplied under this Agreement infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. HP will rely on your prompt notification of the claim and cooperation with our defense. HP may modify the software so as to be non-infringing and materially equivalent, or we may procure a license. If these options are not available, we will refund to you the amount paid for the affected product in the first year or the depreciated value thereafter. HP is not responsible for claims resulting from any unauthorized use of the software.

10. Limitation of Liability. HP’s liability to you under this Agreement is limited to the amount actually paid by you to HP for the relevant software, except for amounts in Section 9 (“Intellectual Property Rights Infringement”). Neither you nor HP will be liable for lost revenues or profits, downtime costs, loss or damage to data or indirect, special or consequential costs or damages. This provision does not limit either party’s liability for: unauthorized use of intellectual property, death or bodily injury caused by its negligence; acts of fraud; willful repudiation of the Agreement; or any liability that may not be excluded or limited by applicable law.

11. Termination. This Agreement is effective until terminated or in the case of a limited-term license, upon expiration; however, your rights under this Agreement terminate if you fail to comply with it. Immediately upon termination or expiration, you will destroy the software and documentation and any copies, or return to them to HP. You may keep one copy of software and documentation for archival purposes. We may ask you to certify in writing you have complied with this section. Warranty disclaimers, the limitation of liability, this termination provision, and Section 15 (“General”) survive termination. Warranty disclaimers, Section 9 (“Intellectual Property Infringement”), the limitation of liability, this termination provision, and Section 12 (“General”) each survive termination.

12. General.
a. Assignment. You may not assign this Agreement without prior written consent of HP, payment of transfer fees and compliance with HP’s software license transfer policies. Authorized assignments will terminate your license to the software and you must deliver software and documentation and copies thereof to the assignee. You must first obtain the assignee’s agreement in writing to comply with this Agreement. You may only transfer firmware if you transfer associated hardware.
b. U.S. Government. If the software is licensed to you for use in the performance of a U.S. Government prime contract or subcontract, you agree that, consistent with FAR 12.211 and 12.212, commercial computer software, computer software documentation and technical data for commercial items are licensed under HP’s standard commercial license.
c. Global Trade Compliance. You agree to comply with the trade-related laws and regulations of the U.S. and other national governments. If you export, import or otherwise transfer products provided under this Agreement, you will be responsible for obtaining any required export or import authorizations. You confirm that you are not located in a country that is subject to trade control sanctions (such as Cuba, Iran, N. Korea, N. Sudan, and Syria) and further agree that you will not re-transfer or allow the re-transfer of the Software to any such country. HP may suspend its performance under this Agreement to the extent required by laws applicable to either party. The Software is restricted from being used for the design or development of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or missile technology without the prior permission of the U.S. government. Please refer to the Export Administration Regulations Website maintained by the U.S. Government Printing Office for further information, located at: http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/index.html.
d. Audit. HP may audit you for compliance with the software license terms. Upon reasonable notice, HP may conduct an audit during normal business hours (with the audit cost at HP’s expense). If an audit reveals underpayments then you will promptly pay to HP such underpayments. If underpayments exceed five (5) percent, you will reimburse HP for the audit costs.
e. Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding rules as to choice and conflicts of law. You and HP agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply.
f. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for performance delays or for non-performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control, except for payment obligations.
g. Entire Agreement. This Agreement represents the entire understanding with respect to its subject matter and supersedes any previous communication or agreements that may exist. Modifications to the Agreement will be made only through a written amendment signed by both parties. If HP doesn’t exercise its rights under this Agreement, such delay is not a waiver of its rights.
