 Version 2.17.1 - 14 Sep 2017
- Update Translations.
- Remove AO3 login from get_urls_from_page--login is failing and it isn't
  required anymore for 'adult'. 'Restricted' (user-only) won't work.
- Plugin: Save 'Show Download Options' check in gprefs like dialog geometries.
- Fixes for QQ and AH changes.
- base_xenforo: Fix for extended chars in threadmark chapter names.
- base_xenforo: Couple small fixes for corner cases. -- Except one of them
  isn't, I think it would be pretty common; namely a notice being using as
  first chapter.
- adapter_literotica: Build the chapter a little better especially if there is
  mutiple pages (#225) - Thanks, davidfor
- base_xenforo: Use '/posts/' not 'post' to find thread vs post URLs.
- Add sectionUrl metadata and mechanism for internally normalizing story URLs
  *and* [story URL] sections. For base_xenforo when including thread titles in
  storyUrl. Doesn't effect base_xenforo *post* URLs.
- base_xenforo: Move skip_threadmarks_categories to save a fetch if skipping
  anyway. Will also effect minimum_threadmarks.
- base_xenforo: Don't include thread title in *chapter* url, perfomance impact
  is smaller and keeps from marking a bunch of stuff (new).
- Add delays for base_xenforoforum_adapter.
- Use thread-title URL for storyUrl with base_xenforo to save redirect fetches.
- Comment out some debug output.
- Remove webnovel.com manual escaping of HTML entities, the website now seems
  to take care of it (#224)--thanks cryzed

- Save AO3 'associations' link 'inspired by' links -- included with
  authorheadnotes.
- Limit adapter_wuxiaworldcom removed links to prev/next chapter.
- Don't cache metadata list while building from include_in_ -- Calibre version
  causes problems with removeallentities=True vs False cache.
- Calibre image processing chokes on SVG images. Rejects svg images--use
  no_image_processing to include svg images.
