              </p><p>
              1.7 Certain versions of the Application are distributed in a form that limits the

              availability of some of the Services that can be accessed from that version

              Application imposes a limit on the number of lyric requests that can be made

              in any period. Details on Services and feature sets, and any limitations on

              use for your version of the Application, are accessible via the Application

              from your Device and/or from the source where you originally obtained the

              Application. Even where there is no such limit imposed in the Application on

              <p><strong>8.	COOKIES</strong></p>
              <p>8.1	Like most other websites and services, we use cookies, SDKs and other similar technologies to help distinguish you from other users and so that we can continue to develop and improve our Services.</p>
              <p>8.2	A “cookie” is a small amount of data sent from our server and stored on your device. An “SDK” is a software development kit that serves a similar functionality as a cookie, but for mobile applications. A web beacon actively monitors the behaviour of a user visiting the Website. We may use cookies, web beacons, SDKs and similar technologies to collect, process or disclose information, either in the course of our service delivery or while advertisements are being served to you. This allows us to store and retrieve login information on a user’s system and provide us with data on your usage of the Service and your interaction with the advertisements, which we use to provide you with content and for reporting and analytic purposes.  Such data helps us to improve our Services and enables us or any third party advertisers to deliver more targeted advertisements. Any cookies used by advertisers are covered by the privacy policy of the relevant advertiser. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can usually set your browser to prevent this from happening.</p>
              <p>8.3	Different cookies and SDKs are used to perform different functions. By using the Services, you accept the use of cookies and SDKs in accordance with this policy. The Services serve the following cookies, SDKs and similar technologies to your device:</p>
              <p>(a)	Google Analytics: collects information in aggregate form to help us understand how the Services are being used and from what source you come to the Website. This helps us to estimate our audience size and usage patterns and to improve our Services, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites, visit http:/tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout;</p>
              <p>(b)	Advertising optimization served by Google,Rubicon and Instal SDK: help us to improve and target the advertising that is served to users so that it is as relevant as possible.</p>
              <p>(c)	User authentication cookies: allow users to log in and share activity via social media (e.g. Facebook).</p>
              <p>(d)	Functionality cookies and SDKs served by Firebase and Branch.io: used to recognize you when you return to use and access our Services and to store information about your preferences (e.g. choice of language or region), so that we can ensure that the Services are tailored to your individual interests.</p>
              <p>(e)	Analytical and performance cookies and SDKs (e.g. served by Fabric): allow us to monitor the number of users on our Services, how they use them and the performance of the Application. This enables us to improve the functionality and reliability of our Services.</p>
              <p>8.4	You will need to either accept or reject cookies when you log into our site. However, if you reject cookies you may be unable to access certain parts of our site.</p>
