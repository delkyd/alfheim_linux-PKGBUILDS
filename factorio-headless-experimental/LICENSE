### Terms of Service

The basic rule is: Use common sense. We try to be reasonable, please be too.

- The game is still evolving and is subject to changes in the future.
- We are not liable for any damage that might be caused to you by downloading, installing and using our software.
- Especially we are not responsible if you stay awake all night long playing Factorio and can't go to school / work in the morning:)
- You download, install and use Factorio at your own risk.
- There's always the possibility of a project being discontinued at any time.

##### Paid content

- You get access to the game by buying (single payment) the membership.
- Possesion of the membership entitles you to all the updates to the digital content associated with this membership for free in the future. Specifically this means that future updates to the core game are for free. However this doesn't include any more significant products that we might release, such as a Factorio DLCs, Factorio 2, etc.

##### Steam integration

- Paid memberships are entitled to the Steam key which allows them to add Factorio to their Steam library.
- This Steam key is meant solely for the owner of the membership, from whose profile page it was generated.
- Giving away / selling / etc. the Steam key to someone else is direct violation of this ToS and will lead to interrupting the membership.
- We reserve the right to change the policy of giving out keys with above restrictions in the future.
- People who buy the game via Steam will have an account automatically created at our webpage. This will allow them to use other services we provide or will provide in the future (i.e. mod repository, MP matching server).

##### Purchase and Refunds

- After the purchase you will receive an electronic invoice from our payment processing service.
- After the purchase you will also receive a confirmation email from us with the upgrade code to your new tier and instructions on how to use it.
- There are no additional or hidden fees. You pay once for the product (the membership tier) and that is it.
