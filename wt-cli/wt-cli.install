The pacman package 'wiredtiger', a dependency of 'mongodb', uses `wt` for its
binary, making `wt-cli` conflict in its unaltered form.  for this reason, the
binary of this package is called `webtask`.  It's recommended that you add the
following aliases to your shell's rc file:

alias wiredtiger=env wt
alias wt=webtask
EOM
}
