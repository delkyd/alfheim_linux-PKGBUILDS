NAME
       linux-pax-flags - Configure PaX flags for several binaries

SYNOPSIS
       linux-pax-flags [options] [filter]

DESCRIPTION
       linux-pax-flags  is  written  to configure PaX flags for a set of bina‐
       ries.  It is intended to ease the usage of PaX (linux-pax)  or  grsecu‐
       rity (linux-grsec, linux-grsec-lts) enabled kernel on Arch Linux.

       PaX flags for a set of binaries are collected in YAML format configura‐
       tion files. By  default,  every  .conf  file  from  /etc/pax-flags  and
       /usr/share/linux-pax-flags  is  read. See the CONFIGURATION section for
       the file format.

       Root privileges are needed. If you  set  a  value  to  $PAX_FLAGS_SUDO,
       linux-pax-flags will be called with sudo.

OPTIONS
       -c, --config  <path>
              Override  default  configuration  paths. Requires one path argu‐
              ment. Can contain globs (escape them in  some  shells  (zsh  for
              example)).

       -h, --help
              Displays a short usage message and option summary.

       -p, --prepend
              Do not actually change anything.

       -x, --xattr
              Sets the PaX flags through setfattr, underlying filesystems need
              xattr support.

       -y, --yes
              Non-interactive mode. Assume yes on any question.

FILES
       /etc/pax-flags/*.conf
              Files for overriding the standard flag set and path pattern con‐
              figuration.

       /usr/share/linux-pax-flags/*.conf
              The shipped configuration.

CONFIGURATION
       There  are  simple configuration entries and complex ones. Complex con‐
       figuration for a certain flag set and path pattern overrides simple. To
       override a simple entry with a complex one, the flag sets and path pat‐
       terns have to match exactly.

   Simple entries
       Simple configuration entries just set the PaX flags for a set of  bina‐
       ries. The format is as follows:

       PSmXER:
         - /usr/bin/ruby
         - /usr/bin/glx*

       PSmXER  is the set of flags. Every letter represents a PaX flag. Upper‐
       case enables the flag, lowercase disables it. See  paxctl(1)  for  more
       details.   This   example   disables   MPROTECT  on  /usr/bin/ruby  and
       /usr/bin/glx*.

   Complex entries
       With complex entries it is possible to stop a daemon before setting the
       flags and starting it afterwards. The format is as follows:

       PSmXER:
         - /usr/sbin/clamd:
           type: systemd

       This  would  stop  clamd, disable MPROTECT for the binary and start the
       daemon again. The type option values correspond to presets  of  status,
       start,  stop actions. Currently there exists only "systemd". By default
       the systemd unit file would be "clamd" in this case or the basename  of
       the path in general.

       PSmXEr:
         - /usr/lib/polkit-1/polkitd:
           type: systemd
           systemd_name: polkit

       The  systemd_name  option  can be used to configure a differing systemd
       unit name.

       PSmXEr:
         - /usr/lib/firefox/firefox:
           status: "pidof firefox"
           start: "firefox &"
           stop: "killall firefox"

       This would configure custom actions for status, start and stop.

       PSmXER:
         - /usr/bin/ruby:
           skip: true

       This would override a simple entry for the same flag set and path  pat‐
       tern and cause it to be skipped.

       PSmXER:
         - /usr/lib32/skype/skype:
           header: create

       This  would cause paxctl to not convert the old binary header, but cre‐
       ate a new one. See paxctl(1) for more details.
