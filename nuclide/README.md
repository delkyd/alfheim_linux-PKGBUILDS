Nuclide Package for Arch Linux
==========

# Purpose

This package contains some scripts to help you run Nuclide with other Atom instances.
Therefore, other Atom instances should start quickly.
You also can customize Nuclide without effecting other Atom instances.

# Usage

After installed this package, you should run `nuclide` from command line to do _post installation_.
Then, you can find `Nuclide` from your favorite launcher to start it.

You can install Atom packages just for Nuclide from command line by using `nupm` (wrapper of `apm`) or from UI.

Hope you like it ;)
