post_install() {
   echo "bash-git-prompt

   NOTE: To use bash-git-prompt, you should add the following to your
         /etc/bash.bashrc or ~/.bashrc:

            if [ -f %{/usr/lib/bash-git-prompt/gitprompt.sh ]; then
               # To only show the git prompt in or under a repository directory
               # GIT_PROMPT_ONLY_IN_REPO=1
               # To use upstream's default theme
               # GIT_PROMPT_THEME=Default
               # To use upstream's default theme, modified by arch maintainer
               GIT_PROMPT_THEME=Default_Arch
               source /usr/lib/bash-git-prompt/gitprompt.sh
            fi

   NOTE: To have the colors shown by 'git status' match the Default_Arch theme,
         add the following to your ~/.gitconfig:

            [color "status"]
               branch = magenta
               untracked = cyan
               unmerged = yellow

         And if you want boilerplate to be less prominent, also:

               header = bold black
         
"
}

post_remove() {
   echo "bash-git-prompt

   NOTE: Any already running shells that were using bash-git-prompt will give a
         bunch of errors with every new prompt line, until you start new shells
         by doing one of the following:

            * Restarting your shells (relogging in each of them)
            * Starting new shells (running "bash" in each of them)
            * Rebooting
