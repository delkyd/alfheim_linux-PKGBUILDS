NodeBox 3 arch linux package
============================
NodeBox is a new software application for creating generative art using procedural graphics and a new way to approach graphic design.

Highlights:

- Node based -- the software uses a non-destructive workflow where every operation is represented by a visual block of code.
- Open to extend -- look and change the source of every code block.
- Python or Clojure -- Nodes can be written in popular dynamic programming languages.
