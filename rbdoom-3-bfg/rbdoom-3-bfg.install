If your doom3bfg-data package includes multiple *.lang files under
/usr/share/games/doom3bfg/base/strings, you may find the game starting
up in Japanese or another unwanted language on launch.

To repair this, make a ~/.rbdoom3bfg/base/default.cfg file with the
following line as its contents, English as the example:
seta sys_lang "english"
