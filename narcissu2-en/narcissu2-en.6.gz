.SH NAME
narcissu2-en \- Narcissu Side 2nd launcher
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B narcissu2-en
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
The command "narcissu2-en" launches the visual novel
.IR "Narcissu Side 2nd" .
.
.PP
This manpage documents only the launcher command.
.
Documentation for the game itself, including in-game controls, is
provided separately in the README file.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
The following named options are recognised by
.BR narcissu2-en ,
in additional to the standard
.BR \-\-help " and " \-\-version
flags which should need no further introduction:
.
.TP
.BR \-\-window ", " \-\-fullscreen
Sets the initial screen mode (windowed or fullscreen).
.IP
If neither option is specified, the game will default to whichever
mode it was in most recently, or, on the first run, to windowed mode.
.
.TP
.BR \-\-debug ",\fP " \-d
Enables debugging mode.
.IP
This turns on Ponscripter's internal debugging feature.
.
It's rather verbose, but may be useful for tracking down problems in
the (hopefully unlikely) case where you have any.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-save \ path
Sets the path to use for saved data.
.IP
You should not normally need to use this option; the default,
.IR ~/.Narcissu_Side_2nd ,
should be suitable for most users.
.
.SH BUGS
.
We were not aware of any bugs at the time of shipping.
.
We were probably mistaken, and the entire game is probably ridden with
the darn things.
.
If you must disillusion us, please do so gently.
