    Misc code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
  * 2.3.1.8:
    ASF will now follow common *nix convention and ignore config files starting with a dot (ref: #554).
    ASF will now respect permissions when distributing/forwarding keys and won't send keys to bots that given user doesn't have access to.

    !pause command will now properly deactivate also GamesPlayedWhileIdle.
    Improved ShutdownOnFarmingFinished that previously didn't work properly with 0 IdleFarmingPeriod (ref: #557).
    Improved Steam message splitting logic that should now always arrive in proper order when Bot is forced to split the message because of its size.

    Fixed a small regression introduced in version 2.3.0.9 that could cause !redeem failures to be always displayed as Fail.
    Improved !redeem statuses by adding extra internal Steam network result on top of existing purchase result. OK/NoDetail looks much better than NoDetail alone ðŸ™‚.
2017-04-30 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>

    Major code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
2017-02-05 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>

  * 2.2.2.1-1:
    [!] Fixed network instability introduced in ASF V2.1.1.2. Coincidentally, this has nothing to do with network enhancements that arrived in V2.1.1.6. Huge thanks to Budgie and other folks helping me with their debug logs.
    Added OptimizationMode global config property.
    Added multiple bot targets for commands.
    Unified the format of ASF responses for easier strings manipulation. All responses should start with a newline now.
    Added SteamTarget NLog logging target, available with custom logging configs.
    Removed !*all commands, such as: !lootall, !statusall, !startall and !ownsall. Use newly-introduced multiple bot targets, such as !status ASF for previous !statusall.
    Fixed writing debug log for multiple bots at once.
    Misc code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
2017-01-30 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>

    [!] Added new LootableTypes bot config property.
    [!] IsBotAccount no longer controls looting foil cards, the responsibility now lies in newly introduced LootableTypes.
    Added rough approximation of expected farming time, to !status and alike (also API).
    Fixed statistics reporting not working on older versions of Mono.
    Fixed rare issue that could lead to ASF not connecting to Steam Network.

    Usual code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
2016-11-13 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 2.1.6.7-1:
    [!] ASF will no longer attempt to farm limited accounts, as Valve put hard cards restriction on them recently.
    Added a few command aliases for !redeem variants.
    Added !pause^ command (sticky pause). This is how !pause worked before steam family sharing improvements introduced recently.
    Paused bot config property now works as sticky pause (like previously).
    Improved logging module in various ways - if you're using custom logging config, you might want to check it out. There are many internal improvements, but nothing visible for people using ASF default built-in config.
    ASF now includes new program icon, thanks to @stackia
    Usual code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

    Fixed ultra-rare issue of ASF causing official steam client disconnection due to broken LoginID calculation done by Steam on some Linux OSes.
    Fixed HandleOfflineMessages not working with non-precise system clock (ASF will now allow up to 1 hour of difference between system time and Steam time, previously it was 1 minute).
    Fixed a possible ASF crash in !ownsall when one or more of the bots were not connected.
    Hopefully fixed ultra-rare ASF network deadlock as reported in #318.
    General code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

  * 2.1.4.5-1:
    Added !ownsall command.
    Improved SendOnFarmingFinished - ASF will now also initiate !loot on receiving new items (when not farming), and trades (always).
    ASF will now !loot foil trading cards only on IsBotAccount accounts.
    Further improved overall network stability by implementing heartbeat functions.
    Fixed ASF not recognizing games with more than 255 card drops remaining as available for farming.
    Fixed ASF not following smart redeeming when first account hits OnCooldown.
    Usual code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
    [ConfigGenerator] Properties are now being categorized for easier modifications.
2016-08-05 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>

    Added new CustomGamePlayedWhileFarming bot config property, which is possible thanks to above change. Visit Configuration for more info.
    Added support for --path command-line argument. Visit wiki for more info.
    Greatly improved efficiency of handling multiple 2FA confirmations by adapting newly introduced multi-confirm method introduced by Valve. Thanks to that, ASF can send just one request for accepting all confirmations, instead of accepting them one-by-one.
    Slightly improved internal cd-key validator to be case-insensitive and more precise.
    Slightly improved network throughput on Windows machines.
    Major portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
2016-07-24 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 2.1.2.5-2:
    Updated source archive to solve a false-positive (see https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/issues/127#issuecomment-234313478)
2016-07-12 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 2.1.2.5-1:
    Fixed ASF crash related to being unable to execute WMI queries on machines previously affected by HackIgnoreMachineID.
    Removed old ASF 2FA V2.0 -> V2.1 converter, as stated in previous release.
  * 2.1.2.4:
    [!] Next ASF version will come without ASF 2FA converter capable of converting V2.0 formats into V2.1. If you didn't update your old ASF V2.0 yet, it's wise to do so.
    [!] Implemented new smart and persistent CMs list - ASF will no longer need to ask Steam network for list of CMs at startup, significantly improving startup time. The list is saved in ASF.db.
    [!] ASF logging module has been rewritten and is now based on NLog project. New module supports standard built-in ASF rules, as well as custom NLog configuration, in which you can define your own loggers, targets, rules and formats. Check out Logging section in the wiki to learn more.
    Removed LogToFile global config property, which is now always true unless ASF is running as a service. The file logging is now customizable through NLog and described in Logging section in the wiki.
    Updated internal SteamKit2 ASF library to version 1.8, improving stability and compatibility with Steam network.
    Removed HackIgnoreMachineID global config property. New SK2 version should solve the issue for all affected people that had to keep this property at true previously.
    ASF service is now available as ASF-Service.exe extra binary due to incompatibility with new repacking method. There is also new article on the wiki explaining how to run ASF as a service.
    ASF can now log it's messages also to event log, which is enabled by default when ASF is run as a service. You can override this through custom NLog config if you want to.
    Misc portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
2016-07-08 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 2.1.1.8-2:
    Disable update notifications.
2016-07-03 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 2.1.1.8-1:
    Changed repack tool used by ASF (ILRepack -> LibZ) which should hopefully fix remaining AV false-positives.
2016-07-02 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 2.1.1.7-1:
    [!] ASF now supports SteamPassword also in encrypted form. Visit configuration for info about new PasswordFormat bot config property, as well as security for further explanation.
    Added GiftsLimiterDelay and MaxTradeHoldDuration global config properties. Visit configuration for more info.
    Added !lootall and !password commands.
    ASF can now become installed and run as a Windows service, thanks to @justin-gerhardt
    Commands are now case-insensitive (but bot names remain case-sensitive).
    Fixed rare Steam issue that could lead to ASF trying to redeem the same gift twice (thanks GabeN).
    Fixed rare Steam issue that could lead to ASF crash due to failure to log in, after successfully logging in (yes, you read it right - thanks GabeN).
    Fixed rare ASF issue that could lead to program crash during !redeem command when one or more bots had broken database.
    [ConfigGenerator] Added version check, CG will now ensure that it's running only with compatible version of ASF.
    Massive portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
2016-06-24 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 2.1.0.7-1:
    Added !api command. More can be found on the wiki.
    Increased default value of LoginLimiterDelay from 7 to 10. It seems to solve some recent more aggressive Steam rate-limiting.
    Fixed incorrect calculation of same-type dupe values which could lead into accepting potentially non-neutral+ trades.
    Misc code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
2016-06-20 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 2.1.0.6-1:
    Fixed !2faok confirming only one confirmation at a time (2.1.0.5 regression)
    Divided !pause command into !pause and !resume
2016-06-20 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 2.1.0.5-1:
    [!] Incompatibility with previous versions of ASF - Bot's database will be converted from old V1 into new V2 format, which means that newly generated Bot's database will not run correctly with previous versions of ASF.
    [!] Removed support for linking new authenticator and delinking existing ones, effectively removing UseAsfAsMobileAuthenticator Bot config property and !2faoff command.
    Added support for SteamParental in 2FA sessions. New ASF 2FA uses existing ASF mechanism of SteamParentalPIN to unlock and operate on such accounts, no action is needed.
    Improved security of ASF 2FA - 2FA module will now only accept confirmations ASF directly creates, and not all of them. !2faok command is not affected and still accepts everything.
    Many internal optimizations, bugfixes, improvements and general code review of ASF 2FA.
    [!] Fixed a Steam issue that could lead to ASF not detecting that all cards were dropped already.
    ASF will now state current status of card drops (aka "X card drops remaining") when farming in solo mode.
    Massive portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

2016-06-09 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 2.0.5.4-1:
    [!] Added Steam Summer Sale 2016 with appID of 480730 to Blacklist and built-in GlobalBlacklist.
    [!] Implemented brand new event-based cards farming module.
    Changed default value of FarmingDelay from 5 to 15.

2016-06-03 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 2.0.5.1-1:
    Fixed harmless error when account was not using SteamApiKey, introduced in 2.0.5.0.
  * 2.0.5.0-1:
    [!] Greatly improved primary accounts support and removed AccountPlayingDelay global config property.
    ASF will now ignore initial OnFarmingFinished() event when ShutdownOnFarmingFinished is set, and you've just !started this bot instance, allowing you to issue commands without much hassle. Every next event (including the one fired after IdleFarmingPeriod) will be honored.
    !update command will now ignore (override) AutoUpdates setting, allowing you to force ASF update while still being able to skip automatic ones (on program startup and every 24 hours).
    Fixed valid trades potentially being ignored in SteamTradeMatcher when user was overpaying with cards from the same game.
    Fixed wrong dupes calculation when Steam is talking crap and responding with NULL instanceID of items (thanks GabeN).
    Fixed ASF accidentally dismissing notifications related to profile comments.
    Massive portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
2016-05-12 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 2.0.4.4-1:
    ASF now allows only one trade to be sent in SendOnFarmingFinished when account did not farm anything - this cuts spam related to sending trade every IdleFarmingPeriod, while still sending initial trade after connect.
    ASF now allows overpaying when SteamTradeMatcher is enabled.
    ASF no longer replies to given bot commands when bot instance could not be found and user is not SteamOwnerID.
    Slightly improved logic of selecting optimal Steam CM server to minimize network latency and improve network communication.
    Fixed ASF crash when trying to add new ASF 2FA authenticator with null SteamPassword.
    Minor code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
  * 2.0.4.1-1:
    ASF 2FA is now more resistant to steam quirks by implementing the same logic of try-retry as usual requests.
    Enhanced !status command which now also shows when bot is running in manual mode (such as !pause or !play).
    Enhanced !owns command which is now able to work also with private profiles, as long as you use SteamApiKey for given account.
    [ConfigGenerator] Graphical config generator now uses asterisks for hiding SteamPassword property.
    Major portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
  * 2.0.4.0-1:
    Added new bot config property called SteamTradeMatcher with default value of false. As always, you can find more information in the wiki.
    Improved keys-detecting algorithm, which should greatly decrease amount of false-positives causing bot to redeem invalid cd-keys.
    Improved logic of !loot. ASF will now loot only trading cards (including foils) and boosters, instead of all steam community items (such as emoticons or backgrounds).
    When SendOnFarmingFinished is enabled, ASF will now also send trades when bot has nothing to farm.
    Code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
  * 2.0.3.4-1:
    Slightly modified logic of DistributeKeys, according to #199
    Added new global config property called AutoRestart with default value of true. As always, you can find more information in the wiki.
    Minor code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
  * 2.0.3.3-1:
    Fixed bot not respecting !stop command when initiated during AccountPlayingDelay or InvalidPassword waiting period.
    Fixed very rare bug which could lead to infinite loop (and 100% CPU usage) when bot would get disconnected from steam shortly after we told him to !redeem key and DistributeKeys was disabled (so that bot instance would try to redeem key in infinite loop).
  * 2.0.3.2-1:
    Removed experimental GUI app until it's ready to ship. I don't need people reporting issues for non-finished program.
    Small amount of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
  * 2.0.3.1-1:
    [!] ASF Config Generator is now named ASF-ConfigGenerator.exe.
    [!] Added new, experimental GUI wrapper for ASF, which is named ASF-GUI.exe. Majority of the work has been done by @KlappPc, which made it possible. You're free to give it a try, but please keep in mind that it's not yet stable.
    Added Headless ASF config property. Check wiki for more info.
    Added proper support for handling very long steam responses (over 2048 characters). Bot will now split those messages and send in parts.
    Enhanced !owns command, it now accepts multiple appIDs and gameNames, you can also use mixed queries containing both. Visit wiki for more info.
    Fixed ASF not triggering shutdown with ShutdownOnFarmingFinished when account didn't have any games to farm right after starting.
    Fixed a very rare crash that could happen when refreshing a steam session.
    Fixed rare problem related to removing old binary after auto update.
    [ConfigGenerator] Fixed config save not being triggered when editing collections (such as GamesPlayedWhileIdle).
    Major portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
    ASF now features rewritten internal WebBrowser based on latest ArchiBoT changes. New WebBrowser includes e.g. native support for automatic compression/decompression of web traffic, which greatly helps reading very long steam badge pages.
  * 2.0.2.4-1:
    Bots can now redeem multiple keys also via !redeem command. Visit wiki for more info.
    Added !2fano command, visit wiki for more info.
    Fixed misc bug related to redeeming of keys on offline bot instances.
  * 2.0.2.3-1:
    [!] ASF no longer includes support for converting old V1.0 XML bot configs into new V2.0 JSON format. If you still need to perform a conversion, then you should do that with previous stable ASF V2.0.1.9, or start making configs from scratch.
    ASF can now accept and redeem steam gifts, through new AcceptGifts bot config property. Visit wiki for more info.
    ASF now logs time spent on farming given appID in human-readable (hh-1:mm) form. You can use that info for deciding whether your account requires CardDropsRestricted.
    Added !help and !pause commands, visit wiki for more info.
    Greatly improved handling of session refreshes for primary accounts. ASF no longer requires a restart of steam client to handle session refresh (which also does not require interrupting of farming)
    Fixed very rare ASF crash caused by malformed bot databases.
    Fixed !exit and !restart commands throwing exceptions when executed via WCF.
    Major portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
  * 2.0.1.9-1:
    [!] ASF now comes with graphical config generator - ASF-GUI.exe, which can be used for generating and managing ASF configs. The app also offers tutorial for new users, which should make ASF more user-friendly. Using the GUI app is totally optional and ASF does not require it in order to run properly.
    [!] ASF will now refuse to load standard example.json and minimal.json config files. You're supposed to make a copy of those files, not edit them. ASF Config Generator will also hide and ignore those files by default.
    Greatly improved efficiency of Complex algorithm by reading hours data directly from fetched badge pages (instead of checking every app page)
    AccountPlayingDelay can now be set to value of 0 which will shutdown bot instance when account is being used for playing elsewhere.
    WCFHostname can now be set to value of null, which will make ASF to ask you about the hostname on each startup.
    ASF will now automatically fix non-valid values, such as setting WCFPort to 0.
    Fixed !farm command being able to execute also on non-connected bot instances, it will now fail when given bot instance is not connected.
    Fixed ASF not exiting itself when done executing a command in WCF client mode.
    Fixed rare issue which made it possible for CardsFarmer module to restart already stopped bot instance
    Fixed !farm command not returning Done! output, which was especially problematic when used in WCF
    Debug mode now logs extra info about failed requests.
    Several code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes
  * 2.0.1.5-1:
    Added support for importing WinAuth to ASF 2FA. Check wiki for more info
    Added ForceHttp, LogToFile, SteamProtocol and SteamOwnerID global config properties. Check wiki for more info
    Increased default value of HttpTimeout from 30 to 60. If you need that change in your old ASF.json config, you'll need to do it yourself (ASF never edits configs)
    Added HackIgnoreMachineID global config property, which solves ASF being stuck after connecting to steam for some people. Check wiki for more info
    Improved ASF 2FA security - AcceptConfirmations() ASF 2FA requests executed by trading functions now accept only trading confirmations. !2faok and SendTradePeriod are still accepting all of them
    Added !owns command. Check wiki for more info
    Debug global config property in addition to debugging network traffic, also debugs SK2 module now.
    Fixed rare issue with ASF not disconnecting an account when asked to Stop()
    ASF logger now catches also unobserved (deep) exceptions, which should make debugging easier
    Several code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes. Logging in is much faster now
