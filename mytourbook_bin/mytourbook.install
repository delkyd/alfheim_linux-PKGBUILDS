Internal data cleanup (upstream): The internal Eclipse data is now located in
the mytourbook installation folder. The existing data is not removed from the
old location, it should be removed manually using:

  rm -r ~/.mytourbook/org.eclipse.*

Do not delete any other data from this directory, as it contains the tour data
files.
