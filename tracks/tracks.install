Tracks is pre-configured to use WEBrick as a web server and SQLite as a
database. Simply start the systemd unit and navigate to http://server:10008/

  # systemctl start tracks

If you want to use your own webserver or a different database please consult
the Tracks installation documentation here:

  https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/blob/master/doc/installation.md

All tracks data is stored in /usr/share/webapps/tracks/ (where you'll need to
run the commands listed in the documentation)
