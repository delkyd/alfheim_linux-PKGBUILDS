Description: Arch Linux, phlipple-svn (AUR) package.
 This patch obtaied from Debian sources.
 Here is a description from original patch.
 ------------------------------------------
 Link with libm for cos().
 This is fallout from the fact that other libraries in Debian, such as
 libvorbisfile, no longer include their own dependencies in the pkg-config
 output.  Until now, phlipple built just fine because -lm was added by
 other libraries; now it has to add it on its own.
 .
 This bug should really be fixed upstream by adding an explicit check for
 cos(3) in configure.ac, something like AC_CHECK_LIB([m], [cos])
 I do intend to do that in a future upload, but IMHO this minimal patch
 ought to be suitable for the Jessie freeze.
