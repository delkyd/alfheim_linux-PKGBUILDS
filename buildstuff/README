IF YOU ARE IN A HURRY
=====================

From a directory that contains a PKGBUILD, run:

	arch.build i686

This will build the package for the given architecture. You may also append a
list of repositories to use on top of [core], [extra], and [community], for
instance:

	arch.build x86_64 testing multilib-testing multilib


FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE
======================

Enable hardware virtualization.

Make /tmp a tmpfs. (This is where the copy-on-write drive is stored.)

Make the host and guest share their pacman package cache using the proxy.cgi
script:
- install any HTTP server on the host
- make this sript run as CGI when called as http://10.0.2.2/proxy.cgi
- make /var/cache/pacman/pkg writeable by this CGI instance


REQUIREMENTS FOR ARCH.INSTALL
=============================

The arch.install script creates an Arch Linux disk image which:
- has [base] and [base-devel] installed
- has a "user" user able to sudo at will
- boots unattended with networking enabled
- runs an SSH daemon accepting the host user's keys

Once created, this disk image is read-only most of the time: the virtual
machines created in arch.build use copy-on-write on top of it.
